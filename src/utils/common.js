        desc:'A blog is typically a section of your business website -- but, unlike the rest of your website, you need to update the blog section frequently by adding new posts. Additionally, your blog is a tool that allows you to engage more with an audience, either by analyzing how many readers share your blog posts on social, or by allowing readers to comment on your individual posts. In this way, a blog is more like a two-way conversation than the rest of your website. However, a blog can also be an entire website, and often is, if the blog is for personal use alone -- for instance, a travel blog.'

A lifestyle blog typically covers multiple hobbies or talents of the writer, rather than focusing on one subject alone.

A lifestyle blog is often highly personalized, so it can often feel like youre reading a friend curated journal entries.'
